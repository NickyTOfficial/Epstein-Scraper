## This is the Epstein-Scraper project
The easiest way to run this is by cloning this repository in VS code, with the proper python extensions installed.

Configure the YAML file as you see fit, the options should be pretty self explanatory.

This scraper automatically converts any "No Images Produced" PDFs into appropriate file formats. 
It parallelizes downloads to speed up data recovery. 

It currently does not have any way of resuming a stopped downnload, you can however specify which datasets to comb.

Use at your own risk, there may be CSAM in the files.
