## This is the Epstein-Scraper project
The easiest way to run this is by cloning this repository in VS code, with the proper python extensions installed.

Configure the YAML file as you see fit, the options should be pretty self explanatory.

I implemented a download pool to more efficiently comb through the files. 

It will resume downloading automatically. 

Use at your own risk, there may be CSAM in the files.
